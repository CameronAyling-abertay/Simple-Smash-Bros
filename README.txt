Hello! My name is Cameron, and this was my the project I created for my computer science A-Level. It's a small clone of Nintendo's Super Smash Brothers but technically legally distinct.

This game requires that python and pygame are installed on the user's computer in order to function properly.

Python can be installed at https://www.python.org/downloads/
pygame can be installed from the command prompt after python is insalled using the command 'python -m pip install pygame'

Please enjoy!
